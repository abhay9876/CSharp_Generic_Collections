# CSharp_Generic_Collections

## Description  
This repository is created to master **C# Generics and Collections Framework** through real-world problem solving and hands-on implementations.  
It focuses on understanding type safety, reusability, performance, and internal working of generic classes and collection data structures using a **branch-wise learning approach**.

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** .NET 8  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code 
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Repository Structure & Branches  

### `generic` Branch  
- Generic Classes  
- Generic Methods  
- Generic Constraints 
- Custom Generic Data Structures  
- Real-World Problems 

Purpose:  
> To understand how Generics provide type safety, code reusability, and performance optimization in real-world enterprise scenarios.

---

### `collections` Branch  
- List (CRUD operations, searching, sorting problems)  
- Queue (Ticketing system, task scheduling, real-time processing)  
- Set (Duplicate removal, union, intersection, uniqueness problems)  
- Map / Dictionary Implementation

Purpose:  
> To gain strong command over C# Collection classes and solve practical problems using List, Queue, Set, and Dictionary with time complexity analysis.
